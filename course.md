To begin work on their master&#39;s thesis, students must complete 27 credits of coursework in the Information Technology graduate program. While research work is being completed, the student registers in the **COMP 899 Master&#39;s Thesis** course. Upon successful completion of the thesis, the faculty thesis advisor submits a **CR** grade for course.

Master&#39;s students are allowed six credits maximum under COMP 899 for their program at UNH. If progress is made with the thesis work, but the thesis is not finalized at the end of the term, the thesis advisor submits an **IA grade**. To continue and complete the thesis in the following term, the student enrolls in the **GRAD 900 Master&#39;s Continuing Research** course with the approval of the thesis advisor. GRAD 900 course carries no credit but ensures that the student receives advising from their thesis advisor. Upon successful completion of the thesis, the thesis advisor submits a **CR** grade for the COMP 899 course.

If no or insufficient progress is made with the thesis work, the thesis advisor submits an **F grade** , and the student will need to retake and pass the course in order to fulfill the program requirements.

Students who need to take time off for personal reasons may sign up for GRAD 800 Continuing Enrollment, which carries zero credits and allows students to continue to be officially a matriculated in the program of study. There is no thesis advisor supervision during GRAD 800 enrollment.
