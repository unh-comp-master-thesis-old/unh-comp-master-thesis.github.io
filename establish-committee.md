**Establishing the Thesis Committee**

A master&#39;s thesis has a committee of minimum three members. The chair and at least one other member must be members of the Information Technology graduate faculty.

It is the responsibility of the student to assemble a committee of professors who have agreed to serve on the committee. The student&#39;s faculty advisor can assist the student in establishing the committee; however the advisor is not required to be a part of the committee.

The committee should be selected upon the basis of the members&#39; knowledge of the subject of the thesis, the methodology that will be used, and their willingness to serve.
