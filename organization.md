**Thesis Organization**

A master&#39;s thesis describes independent research activity that includes a clear statement of a problem to be solved or questions to be answered; a comprehensive review of relevant literature; collection and analysis of data or design and implementation of a system; and critical evaluation of how the data or system answer the questions or solves the problem.

The thesis includes the normal elements associated with research, as shown below.

**1 Introduction**

This is a general introduction to what the thesis is about. Summarize the question/problem that motivates the thesis work, and why it is worth pursuing.

**2 Review of the state of the art and relevant literature**

Present the major ideas in the state of the art to date. Organize the section by idea, not by author or publication.

**3 Problem Statement or Research Question**

Computing and engineering theses refer to a problem to be solved where other disciplines talk in terms of a question to be answered. This section has three main parts:

1. Concise statement of the problem/question the thesis tackles
2. Justification, by direct reference to chapter 2 that there is no known solution to the problem (or answer to the question)
3. Discussion of why it is worthwhile to solve the problem.

**4 Research/Scientific Approach and Tools**

Presentation of the methodology that will be used to answer the research questions or solve the problem.

**5 Study Design and Results**

Once you select the research approach, you design the details of your research. The study design is the instantiation of the research approach that has the details of what you do in the research project to solve the research problem (or answer the research questions). When describing your study design in your thesis be concrete. That is, describe what you did, how you collected the data, e.g., you can mention the sources of information and number of informants, give an overview of their roles, describe the artifacts created.  The idea is to describe your instance of the research approach and methods you use as the basis. A common mistake is to leave the description at the high level of abstraction, which only summarizes the research methods from the literature and does not to actually describe your own study at all.

**6 Conclusions**

Typically structured into summary of contributions and future research. All conclusions should be directly related to the problem in Chapter 3 and answers/solutions presented in Chapter 5.

**7 References**

The list is closely tied to the review in Chapter 2. All references must be referred in the main body of the thesis.

**8 Appendices**

Appendices contain materials that evidence in more detail the work.

This format may be altered with approval of the thesis committee to more closely fit the research topic and the chosen methodology.
