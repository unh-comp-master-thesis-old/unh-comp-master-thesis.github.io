**Thesis Proposal and Oral Presentation**
The master&#39;s student will prepare a thesis proposal and present it to the thesis committee. The primary goal of the thesis proposal is to answer the following questions about the work you plan to complete:

- What is the problem/questions?
- Why is the proposed work interesting or important?
- How will your thesis research solve the problem (address the questions)?

The proposal is written after consultation with the thesis advisor and committee. The proposal is 4 -6 pages, not including title page, the abstract, and the references. It is well organized and carefully written. References must be done in the ACM style. The proposal will be further elaborated in your thesis.

The written proposal must be submitted to the committee a minimum of one week before oral presentation to the committee and interested members of the department&#39;s community, in a public forum.

The proposal is organized in the following sections:

Abstract: concisely written summary of the project that includes the problem statement, scope and objectives of the proposed work, methods to be used, expected results, and the potential significance of the study.

Introduction_:_ general discussion of the topic area and problem statement; significance of the problem and impact of the proposed work; short statement about how the rest of the proposal is organized.

Scope **:** goals and objectives of the work to be performed; what work will be done.

Background: presentation of background theory and information needed to solve the problem; it demonstrates that you fully understand the subject and are competent to undertake the proposed study.

LiteratureReview: overview of the topic and what is already known; most recent research results related to the project to convince the reader that more research and study are necessary.

Methods: methods that will be used to complete the study with explanations of major steps of the study, assumptions made, and limitations of the methods.

Expected Results **:** discussion of experiments already completed and what new results are expected; significance of the proposed work.

Work Plan/Timeline: timetable predicting the duration of each step in the process of performing the work and writing the thesis, including completion dates for each step.

Required Resources_:_ resources needed to complete the project work.

References_:_ using ACM style.

Criteria for evaluating a thesis proposal include: technical merit, relevance to existing subject knowledge, and clarity and conciseness.

**Thesis Work**

If the proposal is approved the student will conduct the research in accordance with any guidelines established by the committee. Before any data can be gathered that involves human subjects, approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) must be secured.

**Thesis Defense**

The master&#39;s candidate defends the thesis in an open meeting of the program. The committee may vote to accept the thesis, reject the thesis, or require a modification of the thesis. The outcome is determined by a majority vote of the thesis committee.

**Thesis Timeline** _(When a project spans more than one semester, the deadlines in this schedule apply to the final semester)_
